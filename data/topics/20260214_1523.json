    "content": "Russia appeared to confirm on Feb. 13 the existence of a sweeping U.S.-Russia economic proposal known in Kyiv as the \"Dmitriev package,\" days after President Volodymyr Zelensky first disclosed it publicly.\n\nThe Ukrainian president said on Feb. 6 that intelligence had briefed him on what he described as a roughly $12 trillion framework for large-scale economic cooperation between Moscow and Washington.\n\n\"Intelligence showed me the so-called 'Dmitriev package' that he presented in the U.S. \u2014 it amounts to around $12 trillion,\" Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv.\n\nThe reference is to Kirill Dmitriev, an envoy who heads Russia's sovereign wealth fund and has remained engaged with top U.S. officials, including Special Envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nThe White House twice declined to confirm the existence of such proposals in comments to the Kyiv Independent \u2014 first after Zelensky's disclosure and again following a subsequent Bloomberg reporting.\n\nThe Russian acknowledgment marks the first official signal that such proposals are on the table as the U.S. pushes for a deal to end Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\nWhat's inside?\n\nThat Bloomberg reporting offered a detailed look at what Russia may be seeking.\n\nThe outlet reported on Feb. 12 that Russia seeks to secure a wide-ranging economic partnership with the U.S. as part of an arrangement tied to Ukraine.\n\nCiting an internal Russian memo prepared earlier this year, the outlet said Moscow wants relief from restrictions that have cut it off from the dollar payment system.\n\nRussia reportedly views the restoration of dollar-based settlements as part of a potential peace deal. The memo outlines seven areas of possible U.S.-Russia cooperation.\n\nBeyond regaining access to dollar transactions, Moscow reportedly seeks long-term contracts for American aircraft to modernize Russia's commercial fleet, as well as joint ventures in hard-to-recover oil extraction and liquefied natural gas production.\n\nThe Kremlin has long sought the lifting of U.S. sanctions on its aviation sector.\n\nThe proposals also include cooperation in nuclear energy, and expanded mining projects for lithium, copper, nickel, and platinum.\n\nTo sweeten the offer, the Kremlin signals it is ready to factor in previous American investments in Russia and contribute to compensation for losses incurred after Western companies exited the market following the start of Moscow's all-out war.\n\nU.S. firms would receive preferential treatment if they return to Russia's market.\n\nThe plan also envisions joint efforts to promote fossil fuels globally as an alternative to the so-called \"green\" climate-focused policies.\n\nMoscow's careful confirmation\n\nWhen asked about the package on Feb. 13, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov didn't deny its existence. He framed it as a natural extension of shared economic interests.\n\n\"This Bloomberg article explains something that is quite obvious,\" Peskov said. \"Of course, we are offering cooperation. Of course, companies from both countries are potentially interested in this cooperation \u2014 so there you have joint ventures.\"\n\nRussia has not refused to use dollars \u2014 it was the United States that imposed restrictions on the use of the currency, he added.\n\nHis response marked Moscow's first public acknowledgment that economic cooperation proposals are under discussion with Washington \u2014 a significant shift given the White House's refusal to confirm such talks.\n\nThe dollar gambit\n\nAmong the proposals, Russia's push to return to dollar-based settlements stands out as the most politically sensitive \u2014 and hypocritical.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly argued that the dollar's global dominance is declining and accused the U.S. of \"parasitizing\" the world economy.\n\nPutin has also predicted that U.S. sanctions policy against Moscow would ultimately undermine the dollar's role in global finance.\n\nA renewed embrace of dollar transactions would mark a reversal from the Kremlin's recent policy of \"de-dollarization,\" as Moscow's officials have called it.\n\nSince 2022, Russia has expanded settlements in national currencies with partners such as India and China and promoted alternatives within the BRICS group.\n\nAlthough Putin said in October 2024 that there were no immediate plans to create a single BRICS currency, he noted the bloc's pursuit of financial sovereignty.\n\nThat effort has earlier drawn a warning from the Trump administration.\n\nIn January 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on BRICS members if they attempt to adopt a new or existing currency to replace the U.S. dollar in international trade.\n\nUkraine as bargaining chip\n\nTaken together, the reported \"Dmitriev package\" suggests that Moscow is linking any movement on Ukraine not only to territorial and political demands, but also to a sweeping reset of economic relations with the United States.\n\nRussia sees the war in Ukraine as leverage for extracting massive economic concessions from Washington, while trying to push its maximalist demands for Kyiv.",

The scenario simulated a \u201ccontested and congested\u201d battlefield saturated with unmanned systems.\n\nWe bring you stories from the ground. Your support keeps our team in the field. DONATE NOW\n\nThe overall outcome for NATO forces was \u201chorrible,\u201d he added, saying the opposing side was \u201cable to eliminate two battalions in a day,\u201d leaving units effectively unable to continue fighting.\n\n\u201cThe aim was really to create friction, the stress for units, and the cognitive overload as soon as possible,\u201d said Lt. Col. Arbo Probal of the Estonian Defence Forces, describing the intent to test how quickly soldiers could adapt under pressure.\n\nAccording to the WSJ, one simulated offensive involving thousands of troops\u2014including a British brigade and an Estonian division\u2014quickly revealed a critical flaw. Advancing forces failed to account for the extreme visibility created by drones.\n\nThe NATO battle group was \u201cjust walking around, not using any kind of disguise, parking tents and armored vehicles,\u201d one participant recalled. \u201cIt was all destroyed.\u201d\n\nUkrainian teams relied on Delta, a battlefield-management system that gathers real-time intelligence, applies artificial intelligence to analyze data, identifies targets, and coordinates strikes across units. The system enables a rapid kill chain\u2014spotting, sharing, and striking targets within minutes.\n\nA small Ukrainian-led adversary group of roughly ten personnel carried out a counterattack that mock-destroyed 17 armored vehicles and conducted 30 simulated strikes in about half a day, the WSJ reported.\n\nAnother opposing unit led by Estonian unmanned-systems coordinator Aivar Hanniotti deployed more than 30 drones across an area smaller than four square miles. Even with fewer drones than typically seen on Ukraine\u2019s real front lines, concealment proved nearly impossible.\n\n\u201cThere was no possibility to hide,\u201d Hanniotti said. \u201cWe quite easily found cars and mechanized units, and we were able to take them out quite fast with strike drones.\u201d\n\nWSJ reporting noted that the drill shocked participating officers and highlighted how Ukraine\u2019s combat experience is reshaping European security thinking. Estonian officials said exercises like Hedgehog demonstrate the limits of learning from videos or reports alone.\n\nThe exercise also underscored broader structural challenges\u2014from slow strike coordination to restricted data sharing inside NATO\u2014that contrast with Ukraine\u2019s faster, more networked battlefield approach.\n\n\u201cLessons are not learned when they are identified,\u201d said retired Gen. David Petraeus. \u201cRather, they are only learned when you develop new concepts, write new doctrine, change organizational structures, overhaul your training, refine leader development courses, set out new materiel requirements that drive the procurement process, and even make changes to your personnel policies, recruiting, and facilities.\u201d\n\nDespite Estonia\u2019s efforts to adapt training, doctrine, and defense investment for the drone era, Ukrainian experts warn that many NATO members still misunderstand the realities of modern war. Maria Lemberg of the Ukrainian nonprofit Aerorozvidka said some armies continue training soldiers using outdated doctrines not suited to today\u2019s battlefield.\n\nOne commander who observed the exercise concluded: \u201cWe are f\u2014.\u201d\n\nAsked about that reaction, Probal said the goal was to force participants to think critically and avoid complacency. From his perspective, he said, \u201cmission accomplished.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Representatives of the NATO-Ukraine Joint Analysis, Training, and Education Centre (JATEC) participated in the Red Hyena 45 strategic war game in the United Kingdom, contributing Ukrainian battlefield experience to inform elements of NATO\u2019s long-term policy toward Russia.",

The sweeping move was enacted after repeated reports that Russian forces were buying terminals on the black market to guide attack drones and run battlefield communications.\n\nRussia downplayed the impact of the geofenced block on its operations, but Kyiv officials say that attempts by the Kremlin's troops to register terminals indicate their need for the American-run service.\n\nIn its statement, the 256th said it leveraged those needs to connect with the Russian soldiers.\n\n\"Understanding how desperately this mold would look for ways to restore Elon Musk's dish network \u2014 and the threats this poses \u2014 we, together with InformNapalm and MILITANT, decided to 'help' them,\" the division wrote, citing the two groups it worked with.\n\nAccording to screenshots posted by the division, which appear to show interactions with Russian troops, the Telegram bots would ask the soldiers for information about their Starlink terminals.\n\nThe soldiers then appear to share details such as their terminal ID numbers, satellite dish numbers, Starlink account numbers, and their location coordinates in latitude and longitude.\n\nBusiness Insider could not independently verify the authenticity of these screenshots.\n\nThe 256th said it collected 2,420 data entries on Russian Starlink terminals and their \"precise\" locations, as well as $5,870 from Moscow's troops paying for the faux service.\n\nThe division added that 31 Ukrainians had approached its network asking for opportunities to help Russians register terminals.\n\nInformNapalm, a Ukrainian-European OSINT group, said in a statement that it played a \"supporting role\" in the operation by pretending to complain about Telegram channels that were supposedly aiding Russians with Starlink registration.\n\nOn Monday, the group had posted about a channel named \"russian_starlink,\" which it wrote was surging in popularity but had still not been blocked by Ukrainian authorities.\n\n\"That was already one of the stages of drawing Russian military personnel even deeper into the 'honeypot,'\" the group wrote of the Monday post.\n\nMILITANT, a Ukrainian OSINT group that shared InformNapalm's Monday post, called the initiative \"Operation Self-Liquidation.\"\n\n\"As for the coordinates they sent, packages were sent back. 155s,\" the group wrote, referencing 155mm artillery shells.\n\nThe 256th said it sent the Russian data entries to Serhii Sternenko, an advisor on drone logistics and technology for Ukraine's defense ministry. A spokesperson for Sternenko's foundation did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.\n\nIn a separate statement on X, InformNapalm said that the deception's \"intended effect has been achieved,\" indicating that the operation has concluded.",

We are working with our partners to continually review and improve the results.\n\nCanada and Denmark signed a defence co-operation agreement on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, setting the stage for a deeper partnership after the Trump administration threatened to annex Greenland.\n\nThe agreement was signed by Defence Minister David McGuinty on Friday.\n\nOriginally Prime Minister Mark Carney was supposed to be present and have a one-on-one session with his Danish counterpart, Mette Frederiksen. But Carney opted to remain in Canada following the school shooting in Tumbler Ridge, B.C.\n\nDenmark has sought to bolster the defences of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory, in light of the annexation threats of the United States. In tandem, NATO this week launched what's being called the Arctic Sentry initiative, which will co-ordinate military exercises and the alliance's response to threats in the region.\n\n\"Canada is an Arctic nation \u2014 and we will defend the North,\" McGuinty said in a statement following the signing in the southern German city.\n\n\"Today, this defence co-operation agreement with Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands strengthens our collective deterrence and our ability to operate seamlessly with our NATO partners in the High North. Today, we send a clear message \u2014 the Arctic is secure, and we will keep it that way.\"\n\nThe co-operation agreement is not a formal treaty and doesn't commit Canada to defending Danish sovereignty over and above the commitments that already exist under NATO's Article 5, that an attack on one is an attack on all.\n\nWATCH | Why does Trump want Greenland? What's with Trump\u2019s obsession with Greenland? | About That | Duration 12:38 U.S. president-elect Donald Trump has long been fascinated with owning and controlling Greenland, spanning from his interest in buying the country in 2019, to his recent refusal to rule out taking it by military force. Andrew Chang explores four potential reasons why Trump calls ownership of Greenland 'an absolute necessity.' Images provided by Getty Images, Reuters and The Canadian Press.\n\nSenior federal officials, speaking on background at a technical briefing this week, said the new agreement captures and improves upon many of the aspects of defence co-operation that already exist between Canada and Denmark.\n\nFor example, Denmark contributes a significant number of troops to the Canadian-led NATO multinational brigade defending Latvia. Separately, the Danish defence acquisition ministry is a big customer for Canadian-made assault rifles, signing last September a multimillion-dollar contract for 26,000 C-8 MRR (modular rail rifle) carbines.\n\nThe agreement signed Friday increases co-operation in the areas of surveillance and joint operations, the Danish Ministry of Defence said.\n\nSenior Canadian officials, who spoke earlier in the week in a briefing intended to set up the prime minister's trip, said negotiations toward the agreement predate U.S. President Donald Trump's drive to annex Greenland.\n\n\"The text of the agreement has not changed\" as a result of the increased tensions over Greenland, said one senior official.\n\nTrump has long had an interest in asserting U.S. \"ownership and control\" over the Arctic island, saying it was an \"absolute necessity\" for national security.\n\nThe U.S. administration reportedly ordered plans for a \"possible invasion,\" prompting Denmark and eight NATO allies to deploy defensive forces to the Arctic island.\n\nTrump went into the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, restating his demands. But hours after a speech at the forum, Trump met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and later announced he would not use force to take the island and there's a framework of a deal to meet U.S. security concerns.\n\nAlthough no details have been released, published reports suggest the agreement centres on updating the 1951 Greenland Defense Agreement to grant the United States \"total access\" and \"infinite\" security rights in Greenland and possibly sovereign control over specific \"pockets\" where U.S. bases are located \u2014 similar to the British Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus or the U.S. Guantanamo Bay lease in Cuba.\n\nThe political hangover of the fight is still being felt in Munich where French President Emmanuel Macron spoke Friday about Europe becoming more assertive.\n\n\"If we want to be taken seriously on the European continent and beyond, we must show the world our unwavering commitment to defend our own interests,\" Macron said, following up with a reference to disagreement over Greenland.\n\n\"It starts, of course, with continuing to extend our support to Ukraine, but it could nicely follow with fanning off unjustified tariffs and politely declining unjustified claims on European territory.\"",

This order, however imperfect it was even at its best, no longer exists in that form.\u201d\n\nSwitching to English to ram home his message, Merz said: \u201cIn the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone. Dear friends, being a part of Nato is not only Europe\u2019s competitive advantage. It is also the United States\u2019 competitive advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo let\u2019s repair and revive transatlantic trust together,\u201d he added.\n\nThe German chancellor\u2019s speech opened the annual gathering of top global security figures including many European leaders and the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio.\n\nAt last year\u2019s conference, held a few weeks into Trump\u2019s second term, the US vice-president, JD Vance, stunned European leaders by lecturing them about the state of democracy and freedom of speech on the continent \u2013 a moment that set the tone for the last year.\n\nView image in fullscreen The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, met Friedrich Merz at a bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the conference. Photograph: Liesa Johannssen/AFP/Getty\n\nA series of statements and moves from the Trump administration targeting allies has followed, including Trump\u2019s threat last month to impose new tariffs on several European countries in a move to secure US control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, a Nato ally.\n\nMerz drew most applause from an audience brimming with hostility toward US unilateralism when he directly criticised the current American administration, saying: \u201cThe culture war of the Maga movement is not ours. Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech is directed against human dignity and the basic law. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade. We stand by climate agreements and the World Health Organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the age of great powers, our freedom is no longer a given. It is threatened,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cfirmness and willpower will be needed to assert this freedom\u201d. Challenging Trump\u2019s unilateral style, Merz added: \u201cAutocracies may have followers, democracies have partners and allies.\u201d\n\n2:06 Munich Security Conference 2026: where does the US-EU relationship stand? \u2013 video\n\nAt the same time, he said Europe must cast off its excessive dependence on the US, emphasising: \u201cWe won\u2019t do that by writing off Nato.\u201d\n\nHe also urged the US president to recognise it was still possible to exhaust Russia economically and militarily, to the point where it was willing to come to the negotiating table over Ukraine.\n\nWith Germany one of the European countries doing the most to boost its own defence spending, Merz clearly felt in a strong enough position to insist the US needed to do more to listen to European concerns about its security and the legitimacy of a sustained European pillar of Nato.\n\nDescribing the Munich conference as a seismograph for the state of US-European relations, he said the Ukraine war \u201chad forced Europe to return from a vacation from world history. Together we have entered an era that is once again marked by power and big-power politics.\u201d\n\nThese big powers, Merz said, \u201cmake their own rules. It is fast, harsh and often unpredictable. These powers exploit natural resources, technologies and supply chains using them as bargaining tools.\u201d\n\nMerz was speaking as the fourth anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine approaches and one year after Vance used his speech in the same hall to criticise Europeans for not taking enough control of their own defence arrangements and ignoring the demands of their electorates.\n\nMerz responded by saying it was crucial for the continent to change its mindset and fully exploit the \u201cenormous\u201d military, political, economic and technological potential of a \u201csovereign Europe\u201d. Germany was striving for \u201cpartnership-based leadership\u201d in Europe but retained no \u201chegemonic fantasies\u201d.\n\nView image in fullscreen The French president, Emmanuel Macron, arrives at the conference in Munich. Photograph: Thomas Kienzle/AP\n\nMerz said he had begun talks with Macron about a European nuclear deterrent. This, he said, must be firmly integrated into Nato\u2019s nuclear arsenal and would not result in some parts of Europe being more defended than others. The chancellor stated that Germany was not abandoning Nato but wanted to establish a \u201cstrong, self-sustaining pillar\u201d within the alliance.\n\nIn his speech Macron insisted Europe must be at the table to negotiate a new arms control settlement with Russia covering ballistic missiles, deep strike capacity, defence technology and nuclear weapons.\n\nThe French president said previous arms control treaties such as the now defunct INF Treaty were negotiated only by the US and this could not be repeated if Europe was to be taken seriously as a geopolitical power.\n\nHe said initial talks about new European security architecture had already been held with the UK and Germany, but it was now time to broaden the consultations across Europe.\n\n0:53 Emmanuel Macron: Time for Europe to become geopolitical power \u2013 video\n\nMacron warned a Ukrainian peace settlement required applying extra pressure, but even if an agreement was reached Europe faced the challenge of how to \u201ccoexist with an unreconstructed aggressive Russia on our borders\u201d that has \u201ca bloated army and a defence industry on a sugar high\u201d.\n\nCalling for a transparent independent European channel of communication with Russia, he said the post second world war security architecture had been \u201ctotally designed and framed during the cold war times\u201d and needed a new articulation.\n\nAddressing the criticisms directed at Europe last year by Vance, Macron said \u201cEurope has been vilified \u2026 as a repressive continent where speech is not free and where alternative facts cannot claim the same right of citizenship as truth itself \u2013 that outdated and cumbersome concept.\u201d",

Bragg, North Carolina, and after he confirmed earlier in the day that he\u2019s deploying a second aircraft carrier group to the Mideast.\n\nOther WRAL Top Stories\n\n\u201cIt seems like that would be the best thing that could happen,\u201d Trump said in an exchange with reporters when asked about pressing for the ouster of the Islamic clerical rule in Iran. \u201cFor 47 years, they\u2019ve been talking and talking and talking.\u201d\n\nThe president has suggested in recent weeks that his top priority is for Iran to further scale back its nuclear program, but on Friday he suggested that's only one aspect of concessions the U.S. needs Iran to make.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who traveled to Washington this week for talks with Trump, has been pressing for any deal to include steps to neutralize Iran's ballistic missile program and end its funding for proxy groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah.\n\n\u201cIf we do it, that would be the least of the mission,\u201d Trump said of targeting Tehran's nuclear program, which suffered significant setbacks in U.S. military strikes last year.\n\nIran has insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Before the June war, Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments advocating for a potential end to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u2019s rule come just weeks after Secretary of State Marco Rubio said a potential change in power in Iran would be \u201cfar more complex\u201d than the administration\u2019s recent effort to oust Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power.\n\nRubio, during a Senate hearing last month, noted that with Iran \u201cyou\u2019re talking about a regime that\u2019s in place for a very long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s going to require a lot of careful thinking, if that eventuality ever presents itself,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nTrump said the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier, is being sent from the Caribbean Sea to the Mideast to join other warships and military assets the U.S. has built up in the region.\n\nTrump had suggested another round of talks with the Iranians was planned for this week, but those negotiations didn\u2019t materialize as one of Tehran's top security officials visited Oman and Qatar and exchanged messages with U.S. intermediaries.\n\n\u201cIn case we don\u2019t make a deal, we\u2019ll need it,\u201d Trump told reporters about the second carrier. He added, \u201cIt\u2019ll be leaving very soon.\u201d\n\nAlready, Gulf Arab nations have warned any attack could spiral into another regional conflict in a Mideast still reeling from the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, Iranians are beginning to hold 40-day mourning ceremonies for the thousands killed in Tehran's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests last month, adding to the internal pressure faced by the sanctions-battered Islamic Republic.\n\nThe Ford, whose new deployment was first reported by The New York Times, will join the USS Abraham Lincoln and its accompanying guided-missile destroyers, which have been in the region for over two weeks. U.S. forces already have shot down an Iranian drone that approached the Lincoln on the same day last week that Iran tried to stop a U.S.-flagged ship in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nTrump in exchanges with reporters on Friday still offered measured hope that a deal can be struck with Iran.\n\n\u201cGive us the deal that they should have given us the first time,\" Trump said about how U.S. military action can be avoided. \"If they give us the right deal, we won\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nFord had been part of Venezuela strike force\n\nIt would be a quick turnaround for the Ford, which Trump sent from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean last October as the administration built up a huge military presence in the lead-up to the surprise raid last month that captured Maduro.\n\nIt also appears to be at odds with the Trump administration\u2019s national security and defense strategies, which put an emphasis on the Western Hemisphere over other parts of the world.\n\nIn response to questions about the movement of the Ford, U.S. Southern Command said U.S. forces in Latin America will continue to \"counter illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile force posture evolves, our operational capability does not,\u201d Col. Emanuel Ortiz, spokesperson for Southern Command, said in a statement. U.S. \u201cforces remain fully ready to project power, defend themselves, and protect U.S. interests in the region.\u201d\n\nThe Ford strike group will bring more than 5,000 additional troops to the Middle East but few capabilities or weapons that don't already exist within the Lincoln group. Having two carriers will double the number of aircraft and munitions that are available to military planners and Trump.\n\nGiven the Ford\u2019s current position in the Caribbean, it will likely be weeks before it is off the coast of Iran.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to use force to compel Iran to agree to constrain its nuclear program and earlier over Tehran\u2019s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests.\n\nIran and the United States held indirect talks in Oman a week ago, and Trump later warned Tehran that failure to reach an agreement with his administration would be \u201cvery traumatic.\u201d Similar talks last year ultimately broke down in June as Israel launched what became a 12-day war on Iran that included the U.S. bombing Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nLong carrier deployments affect crews and ships\n\nThe USS Ford, meanwhile, first set sail in late June 2025, which means the crew will soon have been deployed for eight months. While it is unclear how long the ship will remain in the Middle East, the move sets the crew up for an unusually long deployment.\n\nThe Navy\u2019s top officer, Adm. Daryl Caudle, told reporters last month that keeping the Ford longer at sea would be \u201chighly disruptive\u201d and that he was \u201ca big non-fan of extensions.\u201d\n\nCarriers are typically deployed for six or seven months. \u201cWhen it goes past that, that disrupts lives, it disrupts things ... funerals that were planned, marriages that were planned, babies that were planned,\u201d Caudle said.\n\nHe said extending the Ford would complicate its maintenance and upkeep by throwing off the schedule of repairs, adding more wear and tear, and increasing the equipment that will need attention.\n\nFor comparison, the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower had a nine-month deployment to the Middle East in 2023 and 2024, when it spent much of its time engaged with the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The ship entered maintenance in early 2025 as scheduled, but it blew past its planned completion date of July and remains in the shipyard to this day.\n\nCaudle told The Associated Press in a recent interview that his vision is to deploy smaller, newer ships when possible instead of consistently turning to huge aircraft carriers.\n\n___\n\nMadhani reported from West Palm Beach, Fla., and Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.
