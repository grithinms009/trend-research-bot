According to Western Digital, thanks to a surge in demand from its enterprise customers, the consumer market now accounts for just 5 percent of the company's revenue.\n\nAI companies have been eating up computer hardware as industry growth accelerates. Prices for products ranging from computer processors to video game consoles have skyrocketed due to these AI companies cannibalizing supply chains.\n\nThe tech industry has already been experiencing a shortage of memory due to demand from AI companies. PC makers have been forced to raise RAM prices on a near-regular basis as shortages persist. Video game console makers, like Sony, have even reportedly considered pushing the next PlayStation launch beyond the planned 2027 release in hopes that AI-related hardware shortages would be resolved by then.\n\nWith this latest news from Western Digital, it appears the ever-increasing demands from AI companies for memory and storage will continue to grow, with no end in sight. Unless, of course, investors decide to pull back from AI over fears that AI's promises may not come to fruition. But, for now at least, the shortages \u2013 and price hikes for consumers \u2013 will continue.",

    "full_article_text": "Japan just put the world\u2019s first commercial 30% hydrogen gas engine up for sale, complete with warranty and retrofit potential.\n\nThe world\u2019s first commercial gas engine capable of running on a 30 percent hydrogen blend is now available for order. It arrives with a warranty, a service schedule, and a price tag. Kawasaki Heavy Industries began accepting orders for the KG series hydrogen co-firing engine in late September 2025, following an 11 month verification test at its Kobe works.\n\nThe engine burns a mixture of up to 30 percent hydrogen by volume with natural gas, a threshold that requires minimal modification to existing pipeline infrastructure. But the fuel itself remains scarce. Japan imports nearly all its energy, and commercial scale hydrogen supply chains are still years from completion.\n\nA Transition Technology With Retrofit Roots\n\nThe KG series engine is not designed to run on pure hydrogen, at least not yet. The 30 percent blend represents what the company calls a drop in compatibility level, meaning facilities equipped with natural gas systems can adopt the engine without replacing distribution lines or storage tanks.\n\nThe company\u2019s gas engines division has spent more than a decade refining the underlying platform. Earlier generation KG series gas engines, which have received over 240 orders since 2011, can be converted to hydrogen co firing specifications. That means a power plant built a decade ago on natural gas can begin burning a fuel that did not exist in commercial quantities when the plant was designed. The retrofit pathway extends asset life while gradually decarbonizing fuel inputs, avoiding the capital cost of complete fleet replacement.\n\nSimulated image of the gas engine after modifications to accommodate mixed-fuel combustion using hydrogen. \u00a9 Kawasaki Heavy Industries\n\nKawasaki\u2019s verification testing ran from October 2024 through September 2025 and focused on operational factors that laboratory demonstrations cannot replicate. Engineers tested hydrogen supply chain integration, maintainability, and safety protocols, particularly leak detection and purge systems designed for hydrogen\u2019s unusual behavior.\n\nHydrogen molecules are the smallest in existence. They escape through seals that hold methane, they embrittle certain metals over time, and they ignite across a wider range of fuel to air ratios than natural gas. The KG series incorporates hydrogen leak detectors positioned throughout the fuel delivery system and nitrogen purge mechanisms that inert the fuel lines during startup, shutdown, or fault conditions.\n\nMarine Propulsion Follows a Similar Path\n\nThe stationary power announcement arrived alongside parallel progress in a different sector. On October 28, 2025, Kawasaki, Yanmar, and Japan Engine Corporation announced the completion of what they described as the world\u2019s first land based operation of marine hydrogen engines.\n\nThe demonstration tested multiple engine classes using a newly developed liquefied hydrogen fuel supply system. Kawasaki and Yanmar demonstrated stable hydrogen combustion in medium speed four stroke engines at rated output. Japan Engine is developing a low speed two stroke hydrogen engine, the type used for main propulsion on large container ships, with first operation scheduled for spring 2026.\n\nPlanned layout of the completed verification testing facilities. \u00a9 Kawasaki Heavy Industries\n\nAll three engines share a dual fuel architecture. They can switch between hydrogen and conventional diesel as needed. That redundancy addresses a practical constraint of hydrogen shipping. Fuel availability will vary by route and by port until bunkering infrastructure matures, which could take decades. A vessel capable of burning hydrogen when available and diesel when necessary can operate through the transition period rather than waiting for it to end.\n\nThe marine project operates under Japan\u2019s Green Innovation Fund, administered by NEDO, the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization. The Japanese government has committed approximately 2 trillion yen, roughly 13 billion US dollars, to the fund as part of the strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nThe Infrastructure That Does Not Yet Exist\n\nBoth the stationary power and marine initiatives depend on infrastructure that remains under construction. Kawasaki is addressing this through simultaneous investment in hydrogen supply chains, a strategy detailed on the corporate website.\n\nIn November 2025, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Japan Suiso Energy broke ground on the Kawasaki LH2 Terminal in Ogishima, described by the partners as Japan\u2019s first large scale liquid hydrogen import facility. The terminal will feature a 50,000 cubic meter liquid hydrogen storage tank, which the partners describe as the world\u2019s largest, along with maritime cargo handling and truck dispatch capabilities. The facility is planned to begin operations by 2030.\n\nThe terminal is designed to serve as an import and bunkering hub for hydrogen produced overseas. Japan\u2019s geographical constraints limit domestic renewable energy potential, making imported hydrogen a central pillar of the national energy strategy. The partners are simultaneously planning a 40,000 cubic meter liquid hydrogen carrier, a significant scale up from the 1,250 cubic meter Suiso Frontier that demonstrated the first hydrogen shipment from Australia to Japan in 2022.\n\nKei Nomura, Executive Central Manager of Kawasaki\u2019s Hydrogen Strategy Division, stated in connection with the marine demonstration that \u201cliquid hydrogen is a vital key to realising a sustainable energy society, and we have long been committed to building the technological foundation to support it.\u201d\n\nThat technological foundation now includes the engines. The fuel terminals and the ships to supply them are scheduled for the end of the decade. Between now and then, early adopters of the KG series will face a choice. They can secure hydrogen from limited local sources, likely at high cost. They can run the engines on natural gas only, effectively ignoring the hydrogen capability they paid for. Or they can wait.",

A Washington Post ruling summary describes how DOGE team members were given access to databases containing Social Security numbers, medical and mental health records, bank and credit card information, tax details, work histories, and home addresses for millions of Americans.\n\nA MarketWatch summary shared by reporter Angela Moore adds that the records tied to those numbers also include names, places and dates of birth, citizenship, race and ethnicity, phone numbers, and even parents\u2019 names and Social Security numbers.\n\nWhen you combine all of that, you get something close to a master key for many parts of a person\u2019s financial life and government benefits.\n\nSecurity experts worry about this kind of trove because, unlike a credit card, you cannot easily swap out your date of birth or family ties.

A filing summarized on Representative John Larson\u2019s website states that DOGE workers used the third party service Cloudflare in March 2025 in a way that violated Social Security\u2019s own security policies, and that DOGE employees attempted to pass sensitive personal records to an outside advocacy group seeking to overturn election results.\n\nThe same filing says confidential information on about one thousand Americans was sent to Elon Musk\u2019s team, and that the agency still does not know exactly what data reached Cloudflare or whether it remains on that server.\n\nThe Department of Justice has since admitted in another case that earlier statements to the courts about DOGE\u2019s access were inaccurate.\n\nA press release from the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees describes how Justice Department filings acknowledged that individuals\u2019 personal data had been disclosed to third parties using a non-government server, and that DOGE operatives entered Social Security systems without proper authority, bypassing safeguards and putting bank accounts, health records, wage histories, and immigration status at risk.\n\nWhat this could mean for ordinary Americans\n\nIn its whistleblower release, the Government Accountability Project warns that if bad actors ever gain full access to the copied Social Security environment, Americans could face widespread identity theft, sudden loss of health or food benefits, and the possibility that the government would need to issue new Social Security numbers to everyone.\n\nFor most people, that sounds far more disruptive than updating a credit card after a store breach.\n\nMembers of Congress and advocacy groups are now pressing for accountability. Larson and Representative Richard Neal have called for a criminal investigation into DOGE appointees, while AARP\u2019s advocacy chief Nancy LeaMond says anyone involved must be held accountable and that Social Security has to make sure \u201cnothing like this can happen again.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, they are asking the same question many people are quietly wondering at their kitchen tables right now, which is whether the government can still be trusted to guard the data it demands from citizens.\n\nFor now, there is no public evidence that this particular cache has been used in large-scale fraud, and the legal fights over DOGE and Social Security\u2019s systems are still unfolding.\n\nConsumer advocates generally urge people to keep an eye on their credit reports, consider a credit freeze, monitor online Social Security statements, and treat any unexpected call or email that mentions their Social Security number with deep skepticism.\n\n\n\n",

This was a PC for beginner-level users. At that time, Sega only did arcade games, so this was our first challenge. We had no idea how many units we\u2019d sell.\u201d\n\nSato said of Mega Drive, Sega\u2019s most successful console: \u201cAt that point, we decided to start developing a new home console. By then, arcade games were using 16-bit CPUs.\n\n\u201cArcade development was something we were very invested in, so we were always using the most cutting-edge technology there. Naturally, it started us thinking: what if we used that technology in a home console?\n\n\u201cTwo years after we started development, it was done: a 16-bit CPU home console, the Megadrive. The 68000 chip had also recently come down in price, so the timing was right.\u201d\n\nOn Dreamcast, the release that ultimately ended Sega\u2019s run in hardware, Sato said the keyword for the development was \u201cplay and communication.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ultimate form of communication is a direct connection with another, and we included the modem and the linkable VMUs for that purpose,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe had also planned to have some sort of linking function with cell phones, but we weren\u2019t able to realize it. Consumers were now used to the raging \u2018bit wars\u2019, so even though we knew it was a lot of nonsense, we needed to appeal to them in those terms with the Dreamcast.\n\n\u201cAnd so we marketed it as having a \u2018128 bit graphics engine RISC CPU\u2019, even the SH-4 was only 64-bit. (laughs) On the other hand, we extensively customized the original SH-4 for the Dreamcast, to the point where I think you could almost call it something new.\u201d",
